# T.C-Team-Connection

Basically, T.C Team-Connection is a simple window that appears on your website to display text. Visitors can enter text in it and you can see it and reply from your own live chat backend.
This application is a rethought version of an existing chat program. I used it to build it (Node Js). I made it as a practice.
Choose from a variety of chat rooms where you can send messages to each other about the topic of the room.

The following must be installed for the program to work:

- express
- moment
- socket.io
- nodemon
